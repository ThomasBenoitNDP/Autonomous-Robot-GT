# Autonomous-Robot-GT

In a Georgiatech course (CS 7630 â€“ Autonomous Robotics, 2018), a classmate and myself should program an autonomous robot to detect and map mines in any area. 

Moreover, the robot could avoid obstacles, detect human, simultaneously map a new environment and locate himself.

We used the ROS (Robot Operating System) middelware, the TurtleBot 2 kit, Python and C++.

(Note that: the main part of the project is loaced in the "catkin_ws_robot_final" zip file.)
