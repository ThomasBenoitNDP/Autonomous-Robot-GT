# Autonomous-Robot-GT

In a Georgiatech course (CS 7630 â€“ Autonomous Robotics), a classmate and myself should program an autonomous robot to detect and map mines in any area. 

The robot could avoid obstacles, simultaneously map an environment and locate himself.
We used the ROS (Robot Operating System) middelware, the TurtleBot 2 kit, Python and C++.
